# Understanding-PyTorch
This repository contains a series of four Google Colab notebooks which serves as an introduction to the popular machine learning framework PyTorch.

These tutorial notebooks are mostly inspired by the [PyTorch tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) by Soumith Chintala. I felt that there are lot of fine details which the tutorial skipped (or assumed the reader knew). Hence, I want to bridge the gap by explicitly explaining the simpler concepts.  

I created these notebooks when I first started to learn about the PyTorch framework i.e, when I was auditing the [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/), course online. Intially I created this for myself so that I can do a quick revision of all the fine details of the PyTorch Framework. But now I have decided to publish this online so that others can get a quick introduction about the framework. Feel free to suggest any errors, modifications or suggestions.
